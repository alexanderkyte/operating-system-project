-2 ways of communicating with external devices: polling and interrupts
	-polling needed sometimes, but annoying and ties up cpu
	-interrupts better, but sometimes impractical

-all devices that can interrupt connect to the PIC(programmable interrupt controller)
	-pic is only device that is connected to cpu's interrupt pin
	-used as a multiplexer, 8-1
	-all modern computers have 2 PICs daisy-chained together, giving us 15 interruptable devices.
	-PIC can be remapped, can change the interrupt delivered for each IRQ line. 

default mappings:
	irq 0-7 = int 0x8 to 0xF
	irq 8-15 = int0x70 to 0x77

issue: defaults conflict with cpu exeception interrupts. usually redirect irq 0..15 to isr 32..47

	each pic has a command and data port. 
		master command is 0x20, data: 0x21
		slave command is 0x20, data: 0xA1
