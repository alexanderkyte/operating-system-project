-MMU=Memory Management Unit
	-Handles translation between virtual memory(process's view) and the physical address ('real world') memory space
	-Physical Address Space = direct memory addresses of real locations of ram
		-in a PAS-only system, all code must either be relocatable or have relocation tables so the jump addresses can be altered at runtime

	-Virtual Address space
		-Can exist because of MMUs
		-Virtual address can be mapped to any physical address
		-can provide each executable with unique address space
	-Security: because kernel handles address spaces, stops individual processes from messing with eachother's ram spaces

Memory schemes:
	-segmentation:
		NOP
	-paging:
		-more efficient. rather than having individual virtual-to-physical mappings, you split the physical memory into pages and map within each page. 00x for page/process A =/= 00x for page/process B
		-handled by MMU, so more efficient. 

XXXXXXXXX(Monoprocess=/=paging)--DESIGN CHOICE: PAGING.

Paging article:
	-paging relies completely on the MMU
-x86 mmu
	-maps through two tables, the paging directory and the paging table
		-both have 1024 entries, at 4bytes a piece, making it 4kb. 
		-in page directory, each entry is pointer to page table
		-in page table, each entry points to physical address
		-virtual => physical by adding offset within directory to offset within table. possible because entire setup represents one linear map.

-Page faults:
	-caused when process seeks to access unmapped area of virtual memory, when write is attempted on read-only page, or when permissions inadequate
	-Handling:
		-error code pushed to stack, in bits. bit table on wiki page. 
		-kernel must take action specified by these bits. 

~~~

Virtual memory:
	-Rather than simply running out of ram, you want to move non-currently-accessed pages and write them to a swapfile/paging file. "paging out" memory.
	-if done wrong, very costly.

Segmentation article:

Real Mode:
	-A:B used to select memory addresses. 
		Physical address = (A * 0x10) + B
	-For each fixed A, B can vary 16 bits. 16 bits = 64k values. Thus each block of varying B bits, or each 'segment' is 64k. 
	-Multiple ways to point to one piece of memory. 
	-Four x86 segment registers:
		 CS, DS, SS, ES, and FS+GS
	-Registers affected by far jumps, far calls, far returns, and IRET

Protected Mode:
	-considered obsolete, has security issues for multi-process programs. one can access another's memory. 
	-A:B just like in real mode
	-32-bit registers mean 4gb of addressable memory

Differences:
	-In A:B, A is not absolute value. A is a selector, or offset into GDT(Global descriptor table). 
	 	Physical address = Segment Base (Found from the descriptor GDT[A]) + B

Tutorial on paging:

virtual memory:
	-paging fault happens when a process tries to access memory outside of its virtual address space.
	-helpful to compilers, allows for position-dependant code. 
	-must have hardware support, can't be emulated in software. 
	-handled by x86 by the MMU
paging
	-pages can be mapped onto frames, equally sized blocks of physical memory. 
	-average page size = 4kb
	-each process has different page mapping
-Rather than a big 4MB table, you can use the intel compromise and have the 2-tier system

-Page faults:


    Reading from or writing to an area of memory that is not mapped (page entry/table's 'present' flag is not set)
    The process is in user-mode and tries to write to a read-only page.
    The process is in user-mode and tries to access a kernel-only page.
    The page table entry is corrupted - the reserved bits have been overwritten.

-page fault is int0x14, has an error code
	Bit 0 = if unset, page wasn't present
	Bit 1 = write error, unset = read error
	Bit 2 = set means in user mode when errored
	Bit 3 = Set caused by reserved bits being overwritten
	Bit 4 = error during instruction fetch

Implementation:
	We can implement malloc for the kernel without the proper provided heap by assuming that we'll never need to use free. Thus we only need to keep a pointer to the intial ram location that we'll eternally only increment. 
	Some things must be page aligned.

Classic example of how to do it:
u32int kmalloc(u32int sz, int align, u32int *phys)
{
  if (align == 1 && (placement_address & 0xFFFFF000)) // If the address is not already page-aligned
  {
    // Align it.
    placement_address &= 0xFFFFF000;
    placement_address += 0x1000;
  }
  if (phys)
  {
    *phys = placement_address;
  }
  u32int tmp = placement_address;
  placement_address += sz;
  return tmp;
}
